# Redux Form Project

This project demonstrates a multi-step form implementation using Redux Form in a React application. It covers various aspects of form handling, including validation, asynchronous field validation, and conditionally rendered fields based on user input. The project structure is organized to showcase a practical example of managing complex form logic in a scalable and maintainable way.

## Usage
Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate between form steps. Fill in the required information at each step and use the "Next" button to proceed to the next step. Once all steps are completed, submit the form.

## Reminding
In the first stage of the form, there is asynchronous validation in the name section. You can test asynchronous validation by using the product names Phone, Tshirt and Nail Polish to avoid re-entering an existing product name.
## Features
